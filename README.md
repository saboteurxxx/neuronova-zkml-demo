# NEURONOVA ZKML Demo

Minimal end-to-end example of **Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning** for autonomous AI agents.

This demo shows how to:
1. Train a logistic regression model in Python
2. Export it to ONNX
3. Generate a zk-SNARK proof using EZKL

> ✅ **Proof of Concept**: NEURONOVA can verifiably execute AI tasks without revealing data or model weights.
